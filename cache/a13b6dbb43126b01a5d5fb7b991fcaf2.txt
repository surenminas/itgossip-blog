This helps keep your users engaged and provides the necessary real estate to showcase featured content.<\/p><p style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; color: rgb(51, 57, 67); font-family: Inter, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Of course, there are multiple ways to display this type of content, from a vertical list to minimal textual information. An additional way to display recent news is through the use of a box and grid based system. Using this method, you can create the needed space to include a news entry's featured image, the article's posting date, and it's title.<\/p><p style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; color: rgb(51, 57, 67); font-family: Inter, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">In some designs, it's important to keep the information displayed to a minimum. Showing a date and an entry's title is often the only key information needed. Additionally, images tend to drive better click-through-rates and so it's generally a good idea to showcase a featured image if possible. With this in mind, a simple box container system can accommodate these aspects to a recent news article.<\/p><p style=\"font-size: 1.125rem; color: rgb(51, 57, 67); font-family: Inter, Arial, sans-serif; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\">Below is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript required.<\/p>","author_id":10049,"category_id":1,"type":"post","publish_status":1,"comment_count":0,"view":506,"author_posts_count":7,"author_name":"Valentina","user_id":10049,"category_name":"HTML & CSS","posts_count":1}],"end_time":1698661339}
